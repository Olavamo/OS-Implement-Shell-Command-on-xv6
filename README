This is one of the projects in course Operating System.

This project is based on xv6, xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

A ps shell command(just like "ps" in Linux) is implemented
along with a syscall that is required for the command to work.
